## üî¨ Description

This repository contains Mathematica notebooks and supplementary files for the article  
**‚ÄúOganesson versus Uranium Hydrogen-like Ions and Beyond (from the Viewpoint of Old Quantum Mechanics).‚Äù**  
The paper explores the spectral behavior of super-heavy hydrogen-like ions such as Oganesson (Z = 118), Uranium (Z = 92), and hypothetical elements with $Z > 137$, using the framework of Bohr‚ÄìSommerfeld quantization and relativistic corrections.

The included notebooks produce animations of relativistic elliptical orbits in the Bohr‚ÄìSommerfeld model and demonstrate the semiclassical behavior of quantum levels across different atomic numbers.
